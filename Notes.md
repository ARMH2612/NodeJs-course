## Synchronous Code:

Strat from the top of the file and goes all the way to the bottom of it.

## Asynchronous Code:

Starts also from the top until it hits something that is asynchronous and it will execute that part of the code and the rest of the code at the same time.

# What are the events in javascript:

An event is a signal that something has happened
